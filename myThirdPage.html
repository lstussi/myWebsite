    <h1>My Third Website</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align:left">Hello World! This is my third web page.</p>
      
    <p style="text-align:center">This text is now in the middle of the page?</p>
      
    <p style="text-align:right">I can also put my text to the right of the page.</p>
      
    <p> The "p" element in HTML represents a paragraph. If we don't put any attributes inside of the of the "p" tag then it will default to the
      left of the page.
      
      It is also worth nothing that....
      a paragraph will stay together on a page
      
      even if there are

      
      breaks within the text.</p>
